# Mental Health Analysis

This repository contains code and data for analyzing mental health trends. The main focus is to provide insights and results from the analysis using the provided dataset and Python scripts.

## Contents

- `csv_Mental_Health.xlsx`: The dataset containing mental health-related data.
- `MainCode.py`: The main Python script for data analysis.
- `RESULT.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the results and visualizations of the analysis.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following packages installed:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```
MainCode.py
Let's look at the contents of the MainCode.py file to understand what the script does.

python
Copy code
# MainCode.py

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_excel('csv_Mental_Health.xlsx')

# Data analysis and visualization code here
# Example: Print the first few rows of the dataframe
print(data.head())

# Example: Plotting a histogram of a specific column
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data['Column_Name'], kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Column_Name')
plt.xlabel('Column_Name')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
RESULT.ipynb
Let's look at the contents of the RESULT.ipynb file to understand the analysis and visualizations provided in the Jupyter Notebook.

python
Copy code
# RESULT.ipynb

# Import necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_excel('csv_Mental_Health.xlsx')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
data.head()

# Example analysis: Descriptive statistics
data.describe()

# Example visualization: Histogram
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data['Column_Name'], kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Column_Name')
plt.xlabel('Column_Name')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Add more analysis and visualizations here as needed
## Usage

### Running the Python Script

To run the main Python script, use the following command:

```bash
python MainCode.py
```

This script will perform the data analysis and generate necessary outputs.

### Viewing the Jupyter Notebook

To view the results and visualizations, open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook RESULT.ipynb
```

This will open the notebook in your default web browser where you can interact with the results.

## Data

The dataset `csv_Mental_Health.xlsx` contains various mental health-related metrics. Ensure the file is located in the same directory as the scripts for the analysis to work correctly.
